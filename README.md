# Tabbs

## v1 Beta
We just released Tabbs, the kitty bot! We are adding a bunch of commands, like blurplefy, audio, autorole, and bunch more! We are working our tails off making the support commands, which will link to the server for support and a mention command, so when Tabbs is mentioned, it says 'Purr!' or something like that.

Here are all the commands we are adding:

- audio

- autorole

- blurplefy

- imgwelcome

- salt

- cookie

Be on the lookout for new commands! These commands have a huge impact on the bot, so this takes time!Â 

Thanks!
